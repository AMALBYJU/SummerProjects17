himadrip : Great! I guess we should start with the session. Others, who join in later just give a short intro!
himadrip : I
himadrip : I'll be conducting today's session
mnaveenkumar2009 : <@U5B85LK4H|mnaveenkumar2009> has joined the channel
himadrip : Btw, before we start, how are your vacations going on?
tk11 : <@U5BJ1UXQA|tk11> has joined the channel
nihalh55 : good :slightly_smiling_face:
tk11 : quite well!
himadrip : great! :smile: ( failed attempt to lighten up the mood xP)
gpn : :joy::joy::joy:
himadrip : Okay so we would be discussing basic networking concepts today!
gpn : Okay
himadrip : Let's start with some terminologies in networking.
himadrip : 1. Bandwidth of a network
himadrip : Can someone tell me what a bandwidth is?
gautamrk : Amount of data that can be sent at a time?
himadrip : Good!
adwait1_g : Capacity of the channel
surajsingh : I'm Suraj from comp science :P
himadrip : Hi Suraj :slightly_smiling_face:
himadrip : So bandwidth is the number of bits you can send in the channel at a time.
tk11 : Hello i am tejas from comp department
mnaveenkumar2009 : Hi,I'm Naveen from EEE 
himadrip : you might have noticed terms like 10mbps, 100 mbps ,etc. They are nothing but amount of bits.
himadrip : Hi tejas and naveen!
himadrip : So moving on
nihalh55 : mbps is mega bits per sec right?mega bytes would be MBPS?
himadrip : <@U5BNQKM53> : right!
himadrip : B and b are very different
himadrip : ISPs often use this tactic to confuse their ciients
himadrip : *clients
himadrip : :stuck_out_tongue:
nihalh55 : nice move there
himadrip : stupid slackbot xD
suraj7 : <@U5BJ0QQE6|suraj7> has joined the channel
himadrip : B : Bytes (8 bits)
himadrip : In India though everything is mostly in terms of bits :joy:
himadrip : Next we have ,
himadrip : Network topology
nihalh55 : the way in which u connect various computer systems
himadrip : Network Topology is the schematic description of a network arrangement, connecting various nodes(sender and receiver) through lines of connection.
himadrip : <@U5BNQKM53> , yeah!
himadrip : I guess most of you guys would have an idea about bus,star and ring topology?
nihalh55 : yes
himadrip : put a :+1: if you know about them
mnaveenkumar2009 : :+1: 
surajsingh : :+1:
gautamrk : :+1:
nihalh55 : :+1:
mnaveenkumar2009 : I just know how they are connected and few disadvantages/adv
himadrip : @naveen : so can you tell us what they are. A single line about each would do!
mnaveenkumar2009 : Lol .. ok .. bus is a linear network, all components are connected with each by a common linear wire
himadrip : We won't be discussing their adv and disadv today. That is something reserved for your boring networks class in 4th sem :laughing:
mnaveenkumar2009 : Star looks something like a star .. connected to a common comp/server
himadrip : <@U5B85LK4H> Good! keep going
nihalh55 : where are the servers in bus and ring?
himadrip : you don;t need servers in bus
mnaveenkumar2009 : Ring is a circle network each is connected directly with 2
himadrip : and in ring as well
himadrip : Great!
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5CEBRBGQ/image.png|image.png>
himadrip : This is the bus topology, where data can only travel in one direction
mat123 : <@U5CELUGEP|mat123> has joined the channel
himadrip : if the node identifies that it is the destination, then it won't forward the data further in the channel
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5DU4NPAA/image.png|image.png> and commented: Ring Topology
mat123 : Hi im mathew IT 
himadrip : Hi Matthew!
suraj7 : Hi I'm Suraj IT
himadrip : Also, if you guys have any doubts please ask them!
himadrip : Hey Suraj!
himadrip : So in the ring topology there exists something called a token which is passed around in a circular fashion
himadrip : So, if a node want's to transmit the data, it keeps the token and passes the data around to it's neighbour
himadrip : That's how the network realises that data transmission is going on
himadrip : The source releases the token only after data transmission is complete.
himadrip : The transmission is unidirectional but using dual ring topology bi directional data transfer could be implemented.
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5DUQ55JT/image.png|image.png> and commented: Star Topology
surajsingh : What does dual ring topology mean?
himadrip : Here a central hub is used which relays information between the source and destination
himadrip : <@U5ATP83CG> : it's nothing but two rings (*dual* ring :P)
himadrip : So, one for clockwise and the other for counterclockwise
himadrip : Hope, I answered your doubt!
surajsingh : They can work simultaneously?
himadrip : Yeah, they can have synchronous and asynchronous models
surajsingh : Okay thanks :)
himadrip : great! :slightly_smiling_face:
himadrip : Can someone tell me what is the benefit of using a star topology?
himadrip : One benefit stands out
nihalh55 : message sent faster
nihalh55 : source and destination only involved
surajsingh : Even if one of the nodes stops working the network doesn't stop
nihalh55 : other places it goes through a lot of systems
nihalh55 : <@U5ATP83CG> has a better pointxD
himadrip : good :smile:, but most importantly multiple messages can be sent simultaneously between many S_D pairs
himadrip : Guys please be more active. I wish I could know who all are AFK! xD
mat123 : Sorry :sweat_smile:
himadrip : Chill, no need to apologize :stuck_out_tongue:
aryanhimanshu : <@U5BFS7Q2X|aryanhimanshu> has joined the channel
himadrip : Moving next we have addresses!
himadrip : So on a network we need to be able to identify every single node or computer separately and uniquely
himadrip : So, we have two types of addresses : Physical address and Logical address
himadrip : Does anyone know what a physical address is ?
gautamrk : mac address?
surajsingh : Yeah
mnaveenkumar2009 : What's Mac address?
adwait1_g : Like a unique social security number for each person,it is an id for a hardware
himadrip : Yeah
himadrip : MAC address
mnaveenkumar2009 : Thanks
himadrip : <@U5AUG5J8Y> : nice analogy! :slightly_smiling_face:
adwait1_g : :grinning:
himadrip : So yeah its a hardware level address
himadrip : Which is written onto your network Interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer
himadrip : *Note* : Ip addresses may change but MAC addresses are always constant
himadrip : Its a 6 byte address. For example,
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5CHDRJSV/image.png|image.png>
himadrip : First three bytes from left specify the vendor. Cisco 00-00-0C, 3Com 02-60-8C and the last 24 bit should be created uniquely by the company
himadrip : This address does not follow any hierarchy!
himadrip : So we have something called Logical addresses
himadrip : Logical addresses are nothing but ip addresses
himadrip : Now can someone tell me what an ip address is ?
nihalh55 : address when u are present in a network
nihalh55 : ?
himadrip : Correct!
himadrip : Others can also add to the answer :stuck_out_tongue:
surajsingh : Changes depending upon the network the computer is on :p
himadrip : Nice!
himadrip : So, nowadays predominantly we use an ipv4 address
himadrip : ipv4 address is an 32 bit address
nihalh55 : full form of ipv4
himadrip : Can someone answer that?
adwait1_g : Ip version 4
nihalh55 : great xD
adwait1_g : Ip- internet protocol
nihalh55 : thanks!
mat123 : Nice
himadrip : Cool now you guys continue the session!
himadrip : xD
himadrip : Lame-homour strikes again
himadrip : *humour
himadrip : Nowadays due to the exponential growth of internet
himadrip : we are running short of ipv4 addresses available :sweat_smile:
himadrip : So we are switching to ipv6 slowly
himadrip : which resolves this issue
himadrip : as more addresses can be accommodated in version 6
adwait1_g : Correct.only 4.29billion ips can be generated in ipv4
himadrip : Good trivia!
surajsingh : How many bits is V6?
himadrip : Guys if you know some interesting facts, please share!
adwait1_g : 6bytes-48bits
himadrip : IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal numbers
nihalh55 : nice
adwait1_g : Sorry
surajsingh : <@U5AUG5J8Y> yeah even I thought it was that logic xP
himadrip : Same!
himadrip : To verify, I just googled :stuck_out_tongue:
himadrip : Saved my ass
adwait1_g : :joy:
anusha : How are IP addresses assigned?
himadrip : Good question!
himadrip : That's the next thing we were gonna discuss!
himadrip : Now the ISP provides us with the IP address in the real world scenario
himadrip : Now how does this work?
himadrip : So, we have many protocols which handle this
himadrip : Such as BOOTP, RARP, DHCP
himadrip : All of this is nothing but address mapping protocols
himadrip : Let's start with ARP first!
himadrip : ARP : stands for Address Resolution Protocol
himadrip : The delivery of a packet to a host or a router requires two levels of addressing: logical and physical. We need to be able to map a logical address to its corresponding
physical address and vice versa.
himadrip : Intro to Address mapping :point_up_2:
himadrip : Now ARP is used when a host node doesn't have information about the physical address of a dest node but knows about its logical address
mnaveenkumar2009 : If there is only one guy connected to a hotspot his IP will be same each time he connects to it?
himadrip : <@U5B85LK4H> : interesting Q.
himadrip : That's not always the case
himadrip : Here, the device creating the hotspot gets to give put ip addresses
himadrip : *out
himadrip : So, mostly his IP would change
mnaveenkumar2009 : Yes , what if he connects to the same device each time?
himadrip : This is something known as dynamic ip address
himadrip : which i would get to later
mnaveenkumar2009 : Ok
himadrip : <@U5B85LK4H> : doesn't matter, It's upto the device
jeshventh : When connecting to the Internet over a dial-up Modem, your ISP will assign your computer a different IP address each time you connect. If you're wanting to change your IP address, try disconnecting and reconnecting. If you're assigned the same address, disconnect for a few minutes and then reconncect.
himadrip : Yep!
mnaveenkumar2009 : Thanks :slightly_smiling_face: 
himadrip : That's the logic behind dynamic addresses
himadrip : so we were discussing ARP, which matches physical addresses to known logical addresses
himadrip : So finding out the MAC address when you know the IP address of the dest
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5D2MR24T/image.png|image.png>
himadrip : So System A broadcasts a message requesting for the MAC address of B
himadrip : System B replies with its MAC address
himadrip : Did everyone follow till here?
himadrip : Give a :+1:
surajsingh : Yeah makes sense
gautamrk : :+1:
supreethg : :+1:
nihalh55 : :+1:
adwait1_g : :+1:
himadrip : if you have any doubts, please ask! Don't worry about it being a lame doubt :stuck_out_tongue:
mnaveenkumar2009 : :+1: 
himadrip : Next we have RARP, DHCP, and BOOTP
himadrip : RARP : reverse address resolution protocol
anusha : Doubt: Why do we need both the addresses?
himadrip : DHCP : Dynamic host Configuration protocol
himadrip : <@U5D9T35QE> : Good question !
himadrip : Can someone come up with a solution
himadrip : There is a hint above :stuck_out_tongue:
himadrip : BOOTP : Bootstrap Protocol
himadrip : I'll give 2 minutes
adwait1_g : As the IP address is dynamic,the message should be sent to the proper machine.for this a fixed address is required
himadrip : Good!
nihalh55 : i didnt get it
nihalh55 : confused
himadrip : Okay, now ip addresses can change over time
himadrip : but MAC Addresses are always unique
nihalh55 : even when u are constatntly connected to a network it chnages?
mnaveenkumar2009 : Y is IP required? .. there is already a fixed address right?
himadrip : There is something called a lease period
nihalh55 : <@U5B85LK4H> exactly?
himadrip : This is assigned when ip addresses are given
himadrip : <@U5B85LK4H> : nice question!!
himadrip : So, when the lease period expires we lose our ip address
nihalh55 : oh
himadrip : and we need to use RARP/BOOTP/DHCP protocol again to get one
himadrip : Now, why are IP addresses required when you have MAC addresses
himadrip : It's a good question but I think you guys can figure out teh answer
nihalh55 : so first we use ARP then the rest?
himadrip : *the
gautamrk : ip is used for proper organization of the network?
himadrip : Correct! Can you explain a bit more, maybe use an example
gautamrk : mac adresses are too random
himadrip : <@U5BNQKM53> : didn't get what you meant?
swathi : Just to add a point: ip addressing is required to identify computers connected to different networks. 
swathi : Mac on the other hand is used to find computers connected in the same network 
himadrip : Yeah!
mnaveenkumar2009 : Thanks
nihalh55 : ohhhhlay
nihalh55 : *kay
nihalh55 : <@U5B105XAM> ignore my input
himadrip : Okay so since MAC addresses are too random they are very hard to narrow down on the internet
himadrip : every though we can use the maker's addresses to narrow it down to one level
swathi : Also, ip and mac work in different network layers. 
himadrip : like cisco has 00-00-00
himadrip : Now as I said before there is no hierarchy followed
himadrip : So, It becomes very difficult to check, it would be like a "list iteration"
himadrip : I guess if we just switched to MAC address for a moment, it would take ages for a single p2p communication
himadrip : So since ip addresses follow proper structure they are used. This structure consists of a network address and a host address as <@U5CCNE9P1> said
himadrip : Which we would discuss in a while
himadrip : So, did everyone understand?
himadrip : Take your time to digest stuff :stuck_out_tongue:
gautamrk : :+1:
himadrip : <@U5D9T35QE> <@U5AUG5J8Y>  <@U5BNQKM53>  <@U5BJ0QQE6>  <@U5ATP83CG> <@U5DMZS4F8>  what about you guys?
surajsingh : What did you mean when you said Mac addresses don't follow any heirarchy?
himadrip : After the first 3 bytes there is no specific order
supreethg : :+1:
himadrip : The first 3 bytes determine the make (cisco,etc)
himadrip : for example, suppose i have a mac address of 00-00-00-00-00-01
himadrip : the mac address of 00-00-00-00-00-02 could be assigned to any person in the world, like maybe some person from catalunya(barcalona)
himadrip : so its some random person in some random place
himadrip : So, I can't pinpoint the MAC address of my friend living next dppr
himadrip : *door
mnaveenkumar2009 : If it followed heirarchy there wouldn't be a need for IP?
himadrip : p.s: catalunya is where the next F1 Gp race is being held tomorrow :stuck_out_tongue: for the F1 fans xD
himadrip : <@U5B85LK4H>  Exactly!
surajsingh : Oh okayy thanks
himadrip : Great what about others? Did you guys understand?
himadrip : These are the very basics and fundamentals of networking which confuses most people!
himadrip : It's good to see you guys are asking the right questions
himadrip : Il move on then? If you have any doubt, you can pm any of the mentors after the session :slightly_smiling_face:
himadrip : If you have any now, please ask
himadrip : It might help others as well
surajsingh : What do different network layers mean?
himadrip : Oh okay, I don't think I'll be able to cover that today
himadrip : Maybe Next session would be on that!
himadrip : Network Layers come under OSI or TCP model
himadrip : The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model defines a networking framework to implement protocols in layers, with control passed from one layer to the next.
himadrip : More Info on them later (y)
himadrip : :+1:
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5D2S964B/image.png|image.png> and commented: For reference
himadrip : These models form the base of networks
adwait1_g : Is ip address assigned to nic which was mentioned in the beginning or to a computer ?
himadrip : <@U5AUG5J8Y> : good Q
himadrip : I was coming to that
himadrip : So i left of at DHCP/RARP/BOOTP
himadrip : *off
himadrip : These protocols are used to get Ip addresses
himadrip : and match them to their respective Mac Addresses
himadrip : Now when a computer boots up
himadrip : It sends a request to the server handling the ip address
himadrip : The server first checks if the host has been assigned a static IP or not
himadrip : if not it selects a dynamic IP and sends it as a lease ( with a fixed time) back to the host
himadrip : This is how DHCP works
himadrip : BOOTP and RARP are similar, just the used in the case of static IPs only
himadrip : Mostly all our IPs are dynamic which means they would vary
himadrip : Now if you have a static IP (companies like google do)
himadrip : You don't need to worry about the MAC address
himadrip : And static ips are needed to host websites usually
himadrip : Did everyone follow?
gautamrk : yup
adwait1_g : Yes
mnaveenkumar2009 : How do some websites find out farming in games (creating multiple accounts from same ISP and using them to improve your score) if IP varies ? They mention u can't attack a person with the same IP
himadrip : <@U5B85LK4H> : can you give more details, Why would you need ip addresses in mmo games when you have accounts?
gautamrk : i think he meant ip blocks
himadrip : Oh
himadrip : See the lease period isn't as small as you think xP
himadrip : even if you switch off the pc, the lease isnt broken
himadrip : So, you would have the same ip for a while
mnaveenkumar2009 : Oh , thanks
himadrip : So let's quickly discuss the types of ip addresses and wrap up the session
himadrip : There are 4 types : private IP addresses, public IP addresses, static IP addresses, and dynamic IP addresses.
himadrip : You know about static and dynamic
himadrip : Now the other classification : private and public
himadrip : In short, private IP addresses are used "inside" a network, like the one you probably run at home. These types of IP addresses are used to provide a way for your devices to communicate with your router and all the other devices in your private network. Private IP addresses can be set manually or assigned automatically by your router.
himadrip : *Open up the command line/terminal on your systems*
himadrip : For windows (type):
himadrip : `ipconfig`
himadrip : For Linux uses:
himadrip : `ifconfig`
himadrip : If you are using linux, under wlo1 (for Wifi users) you can see your ipaddress as the inet addr
himadrip : for ethernet , under eno1
himadrip : For windows its straightforward,
himadrip : <@U5B105XAM|himadrip> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/himadrip/F5D50BE9Y/image.png|image.png>
himadrip : As you can see, my ip here is 192.168.1.103
himadrip : This is the private ip given to me by my router
himadrip : Which is not accessible to the world (private)
himadrip : So, only devices in my house can communicate with me using that ip address
himadrip : Public IP addresses are used on the "outside" of your network and are assigned by your ISP. It's the main address that your home or business network uses to communicate with the rest of the networked devices around the world (i.e. the Internet). It provides a way for the devices in your home, for example, to reach your ISP, and therefore the outside world, allowing them to do things like access websites and communicate directly with other people's computers.
himadrip : Both private IP addresses and public IP addresses are either dynamic or static, which means that, respectively, they either change or they don't.
adwait1_g : Is it the ip which Google shows when we ask what our ip address is ?
himadrip : Was everyone able to see their ips?
himadrip : Since Google can only see your public IP which you use to communicate with the world
supreethg : yeah
himadrip : It shows your public ip
himadrip : *Finding Your Public IP Address*

There are lots of ways to find your router's public IP address but sites like IP Chicken, <http://WhatsMyIP.org|WhatsMyIP.org>, or <http://WhatIsMyIPAddress.com|WhatIsMyIPAddress.com> make this super easy.
himadrip : So, while communicating with the world, pur data packets go to the router which converts the private ip to public ip and transmits it on the internet
himadrip : *our
himadrip : The ipaddresses with 192.168.1.x are considered as public ips usually which your router gives
himadrip : *private ips sorry!!
himadrip : Note : 192.168.1.x are most of the time *private ips*
himadrip : Did everyone follow till here?
gautamrk : yup
adwait1_g : Yes
himadrip : The session is over! Doubts, if you have any?
mnaveenkumar2009 : Ipv4 is public?
himadrip : Ipv4 or ipv6 could be public or private
himadrip : *either
himadrip : They are just naming conventions, how ips are named
himadrip : They have nothing to do with public or private ip
mnaveenkumar2009 : What decides if they are private or public?
himadrip : The local network
mnaveenkumar2009 : Ok
mnaveenkumar2009 : Thanks
himadrip : Within network we have private ips
himadrip : So when we try to communicate with the world, all our packets has to go through the router or the network moderator(Default gateway) which converts the private to  public addresses if any
adwait1_g : can a single computer have more than one private ip?
himadrip : Nope
himadrip : Then there would be confusion
adwait1_g : Got it.thanks
himadrip : ip addresses are needed to uniquely identify nodes
himadrip : So, everyone understood?
gautamrk : yup
himadrip : rather everyone awake?
himadrip : xP
gautamrk : Nice session, thanks a lot!
himadrip : The doubts in between sessions should be posted on the doubts channel :slightly_smiling_face:
himadrip : You are welcome
adwait1_g : Thanks <@U5B105XAM> 
himadrip : Also, if you have any cool stuff to share, put it up on the random channel

himadrip : Wait
himadrip : before you guys leave
himadrip : Short Assignment: what are DNS servers? What is DNS? :stuck_out_tongue:
himadrip : Next session we would deal with subnet masks,NAT, OSI model/TCP model
himadrip : Yep Thanks for attending today's session!
