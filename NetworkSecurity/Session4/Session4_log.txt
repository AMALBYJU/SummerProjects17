swathi : We'll start at 8:45
swathi : I see just 2 online
swathi : I hope all of you have downloaded the files from github and also wireshark
swathi : If not, do so now
swathi : Hello!
gautamrk : hi
adwait1_g : Hi
gauravud : hello
nihalh55 : I'll come in some time... Breaking my fast 
aryanhimanshu : Hello
swathi : Let's startoff with some common network hardware
swathi : Quickly tell me the difference between hub, switch and router
amalbyju98 : Hi
adwait1_g : in a hub,a message sent to it goes to all machines connected to it
swathi : <@U5AUG5J8Y> good
adwait1_g : and only one machine can send packets at a time
swathi : Others?
swathi : Hubs are basically repeating devices that run only in half duplex mode
swathi : half duplex - Can only send or receive at a time. Not both simultaneously
swathi : They work using MAC addresses
swathi : Hub broadcasts a packet to all its ports.
swathi : It is the computer's job to determine if the packet was intended for it or not
swathi : So systems whose mac does not match , just drop the packet
swathi : Disadvantages?
swathi : Anyone?
swathi : Take a guess
aryanhimanshu : Wastage
aryanhimanshu : Of bandwidth
aryanhimanshu : Maybe
swathi : Exactly!
swathi : Also, only 1 packet can be sent at a time
swathi : If 2 or more are sent simultaneously, packets might get destroyed due to collision
swathi : So a better alternative was a 'switch'
swathi : What does a switch do?
adwait1_g : full duplex mode
swathi : Yes
swathi : And?
swathi : Full duplex mode implies multiple packets can be sent at a time and also it is directly sent to the destination port
swathi : No broadcasting of packets
swathi : Also it works in layer 2 of netwrok model
swathi : i.e data link layer
swathi : Switches solve the problems put forward by hubs. So why require routers?
adwait1_g : routers are wireless
swathi : Anything else?
swathi : Hubs and switches work with layer 2. How do we communicate with systems in different networks?
swathi : That's where routers come into action
swathi : They work with layer 3 i.e with ip addresses.
swathi : Any doubts till here?
swathi : I guess this is the only theory part for today :slightly_smiling_face:
swathi : I guess I'll move ahead
swathi : So, can someone tell me what packet sniffers are?
swathi : It's going to be boring if none of you answer. I'll just keep going on and on
swathi : Might as well sleep
adwait1_g : reading packets which are not intended to us
swathi : Not necessarily unintended :stuck_out_tongue:
amalbyju98 : Checking logs of packets and managing network traffic 
swathi : So a packet sniffer basically captures live data in a network for further analysis
swathi : Wireshark  is a GUI packet sniffer
amalbyju98 : Wireshark is an example
I guess
swathi : It supports protocols from different layers including IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS
swathi : <@U5E8J6VAA> yes it is an example of a packet sniffer
swathi : Packet sniffers work by collecting data in promiscous mode
swathi : This collected binary data is then converted to a readable form
swathi : Then comes analysis
swathi : Sniffing around hubs gives us access to all packets being sent or received
swathi : since all packets are broadcasted
aryanhimanshu : Wireshark sounds cool
aryanhimanshu : Though
swathi : Switches however limit the sniffers visibility greatly
swathi : Only packets intended for the sniffer can  be intercepted
swathi : So what do we do ?
swathi : Any wild guesses?
adwait1_g : connect a hub
gautamrk : spoof mac address?
swathi : <@U5B3HALU9> <@U5AUG5J8Y>  Awesome!
swathi : So <@U5AUG5J8Y> it is called hubbing out
swathi : Apart from this, there is port mirroring, network tapping etc
swathi : You guys can read up about them online
swathi : So let's start off with wireshark!!
swathi : Everybody start wireshark
swathi : I hope you guys have downloaded the files from github
swathi : ?
adwait1_g : yes
swathi : Cool! I guess all of you guys are able to see your network interfaces on the home page of wireshark
swathi : wlp20 , loopback ....
swathi : Click on one of the interfaces, say the one you're using now
swathi : Then hover to the capture menu and click start
swathi : You've started your first packet capture!
gauravud : done
swathi : Everybody done?
gautamrk : ya
adwait1_g : yes
swathi : Cool
swathi : I guess all of you have 3 rows in your main screen now
swathi : The 1st one displaying the packets is called packet list
swathi : The 2nd is called packet details
swathi : The 3rd packet bytes
swathi : In case you don't see 3 rows one below the other, don't worry just change the view
gauravud : :+1:
swathi : <@U5CCNE9P1|swathi> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/swathi/F5J958UGG/pasted_image_at_2017_05_27_09_37_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-05-27, 9:37 PM>
swathi : Something similar to the image
swathi : Anyone has problems?
swathi : The first row just lists all your packets
swathi : The second gives details about the selected packet
swathi : The third is just the raw data
swathi : Notice that every packet has colors with respect to the protocol being used
swathi : We can customize these packet colors according to our needs using coloring rules in view menu
swathi : Name resolution setting is one useful thing
swathi : It allows you to enable automatic MAC (layer 2), network (layer 3), and transport (layer 4) name resolution for your
capture.
swathi : Doubts?
swathi : You guys can always experiment with these. Nothing to teach about here
swathi : You can also add various filters to view specific packets
swathi : Say from  a specific port or ip or using a protocol
adwait1_g : does this intercept packets of the whole network or only packets
adwait1_g : related to my machine?
swathi : That depends on your situation
swathi : Say you're connected to a switch then no
adwait1_g : oh ok
aryanhimanshu : Ok
swathi : But if you're a network administrator its possible to monitor
swathi : all traffic on your network
swathi : using techniques mentioned before
swathi : Clear?
swathi : Ok! Hover over to the statistics menu and select endpoints
swathi : You get a table with info about number packets sent, address ,bytes etc from source to destination
swathi : You can right click on a endpoint to apply it as a filter
swathi : Next go to conversations in statistics menu
swathi : What do you see?
gauravud : two address
gauravud : and packets sent from one to other
swathi : <@U5DCK8ZDX> and packets separated according to protocols also
gauravud : yes
swathi : ipv4, ipv6,udp....
swathi : <@U5CCNE9P1|swathi> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/swathi/F5K28P6G5/pasted_image_at_2017_05_27_09_57_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-05-27, 9:57 PM>
gauravud : tcp
gauravud : ethernet
swathi : Awesome!
swathi : Everyone done?
swathi : I'm going to give an exercise now, so I hope everyone is ready :stuck_out_tongue:
swathi : Open lotsofweb.pacpng using wireshark
swathi : Using the things  mentioned above, list out all the information you can get from this packet capture
swathi : I'll give you guys 5 minutes
swathi : Is anyone here? :stuck_out_tongue:
swathi : Show of hands please!
gauravud : is it something to do with wall street journal?
swathi : Put whatever you think it is. Then we'll analyze
adwait1_g : packet 39:request for cnn homepage
swathi : I hope you guys are making use of endpoints conversations and whois:p
gauravud : i am just checking out the ip addresses:stuck_out_tongue:
swathi : :slightly_smiling_face:
swathi : You guys got the small things right :stuck_out_tongue:
swathi : So let's analyze the main parts
swathi : Endpoints for ipv4 shows that the local 172.16.16.128 address communicates using the largest amount of bytes among all
swathi : 74.125.103.163 is a non-local address, so at this point, you can assume that you have one client talking to this IP address a lot
swathi : This non-local address is the second highest talker
swathi : Time to find out who 74.125.103.163 is
swathi : So open your terminal and check this ip with whois
swathi : What do you get?
gauravud : in ipv4 endpoints i cant find 172.16.16.128 much
gauravud : its there in udp
gautamrk : google
gautamrk : that ip address
adwait1_g : check the number of packets and bytes <@U5DCK8ZDX>
gauravud : ya..got it
swathi : Highest talker in the sense most number of packets or bytes <@U5DCK8ZDX>
swathi : Cool. So the ip corresponds to google
swathi : Now switch over to conversations
swathi : Check ipv4
swathi : What do you infer about the communication between the top 2 talkers?
gautamrk : router?
gautamrk : oh wait you mean with the non local address?
swathi : I mean 172.... local and 74.,...
swathi : See by number of packets or bytes
adwait1_g : 74.,.. is a server which from which the 172... guy has downloaded something
gautamrk : youtube?
swathi : <@U5B3HALU9>  Amazing!
swathi : <@U5AUG5J8Y> you were close :slightly_smiling_face:
swathi : Try enabling name resolution and see conversations and endpoints
swathi : Makes it more readable
swathi : Everyone clear?
swathi : Just another feature to mention, - viewing tcp stream
swathi : Reassembles tcp streams into more readable format
swathi : Open http_google.pcapng and try it quickly
swathi : right click a tcp packet
swathi : Choose tcp under follow
swathi : You get something like this....
swathi : <@U5CCNE9P1|swathi> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/swathi/F5JCB12F3/pasted_image_at_2017_05_27_10_30_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-05-27, 10:30 PM>
swathi : The red text is used to signify traffic from the source to the destination, and the
blue text is used to identify traffic in the opposite direction, from the desti-
nation to the source.
swathi : Everyone got it?
gauravud : ya
swathi : The stream will make more sense when viewing HTTP
swathi : Can I go ahead?
gauravud : ok
swathi : Open download_slow.pcapng
swathi : Go to statistics-&gt;packet length
swathi : What do you see?
swathi : PAcket lengths and their %s right?
gauravud : yes
swathi : 1280-2559 has greatest number of packets in this length range
gautamrk : cant find packet length
swathi : Larger packets such as these typically indicate the transfer of data, whereas smaller packets indicate protocol control sequences
swathi : <@U5B3HALU9> its under statistics
swathi : Got it?
gautamrk : ya
swathi : If there are a lot of large packets, it may be safe to assume that data is
being transferred. If the majority of packets are small, you may assume that
the capture consists of protocol control commands, without a great deal of
data being passed.
swathi : Now open io graph in stats
swathi : What can you say looking at it?
swathi : Can I say the packet rate in highly inconsistent?
gauravud : yes
adwait1_g : yes
swathi : Sorry download rate of packets
swathi : <@U5CCNE9P1|swathi> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/swathi/F5JCD71HP/pasted_image_at_2017_05_27_10_47_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-05-27, 10:47 PM>
swathi : Is this one better?
gauravud : download rate is better
swathi : Yes. Also quite consistent
swathi : Does anyone know what round trip time is?
swathi : RTT
gautamrk : time between when request is made and when response is recieved?
adwait1_g : time taken for a packet to be sent and its acknowledgment received back
swathi : Correct!
swathi : Check the rtt graph for this capture
swathi : its under stats-&gt;rtt graph
swathi : Sorry under tcp stream graphs-&gt;rtt
swathi : <@U5CCNE9P1|swathi> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/swathi/F5K146H52/pasted_image_at_2017_05_27_10_54_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-05-27, 10:54 PM>
gauravud : i am getting a empty graph
amalbyju98 : Same 
swathi : Click switch direction
swathi : <@U5CCNE9P1|swathi> uploaded a file: <https://networksecurity-ieee.slack.com/files/swathi/F5J9FP0NL/pasted_image_at_2017_05_27_10_56_pm.png|Pasted image at 2017-05-27, 10:56 PM>
gauravud : ya..got it
swathi : You should get this graph
amalbyju98 : Got it
swathi : Analysis of RTTs is often done to find
slow points or bottlenecks in communication
swathi : Also checkout what flow graphs show
swathi : And expert information
amalbyju98 : What are 3202 and 80?
swathi : So that's all for today. This session just taught you how to use wireshark. The main objective however is to make sense of network traffic which we have't touched upon at all.
swathi : Ports
amalbyju98 : Thanks
swathi : Next class we'll see how to make sense of various protocol packets and determine information from thrie details
swathi : I expect all of you guys to try all the options in the menu and learn what they do
swathi : Any doubts?
swathi : ?
gautamrk : nope
adwait1_g : no
amalbyju98 : No
gauravud : no
swathi : I'll put up the assignment on the whatsapp group
swathi : <@U5C2P3WMR> will tell you how to upload the previous assignments
swathi : Also if you have any problems or doubts while using wireshark , feel free to ping me
swathi : Good night!
