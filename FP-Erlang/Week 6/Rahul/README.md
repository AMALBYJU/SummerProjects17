# Assignment 5

### Given module contains the following functions - 

add - Curried implementation of addition.

subtract - Curried implementation of subtraction.

multiply - Curried implementation of multiplication.

divide - Curried implementation of division.

isremdr - Checks if a number Y divides X (Curried implementation).

greaterThanX - Checks if a number Y is greater than X (Curried implementation).

lessThanX - Checks if a number Y is less than X (Curried implementation).

fact - Computes the factorial of a number.

derive - Computes the derivative of a function F at a given value X and H.

integral - COmputes the definite integral of a function F at a given value of A, B and N.

foldl - Processes elements of a list starting from the left.

foldr - Processes elements of a list starting from the right.

map - Applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a list of elements in the same order.

filterl - Filters the elements of a list that satisfy a predicate starting from the left.

foldl2 - foldl implementation using foldr.

### Examples of curried functions in higher order functions - 

lessthanList - Filters a given list less than a given number X (filter).

sumList - Computes the sum of all elements of a list (fold).

squareList - Computes the square of each element and outputs a new list (map).

evenList - Filters a given list by retaining only the even numbers (filter).

factList - Computes the factorial of eac element and outputs a new list (map).
