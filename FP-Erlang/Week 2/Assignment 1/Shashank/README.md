Module 1 - myList.erl

Module 1 contains following functions to manipulate lists:

1. append_list(A, B) : Appends 2 lists. Here A and B are lists.
2. return_last(List) : Returns last element of list.
3. is_member(A, List) : Finds out if an element(A) is a member of a list.
4. sort_list(List) : Sorts a given list in ascending order.
5. sum_all(List) : Returns sum of all elements in a given list.

Module 2 - complexCalc.erl

A calculator module for complex numbers. 

For functions 1 to 4, R1 and R2 are the real parts of two complex numbers. I1 and I2 are the imaginary parts of the complex number respectively
1. add(R1, I1, R2, I2) - Performs addition on 2 complex numbers.
2. subtract(R1, I1, R2, I2) - Performs subtraction on 2 complex numbers. That is complex number1 - complex number2.
3. multiply(R1, I1, R2, I2) - Performs multiplication on 2 complex numbers.
4. divide(R1, I1, R2, I2) - Performs division on 2 complex numbers. That is complex number1 / complex number2.

5. arg(List) - Takes a 2-membered list corresponding to a complex number as input parameter and returns the argument in degrees.
6. argInv(X) - Takes a single number as an input parameter and returns a complex number (2-membered list) whose argument in radians corresponds to the input and the magnitude of the complex number = 1.
7. absolute(List) - Takes a 2-membered list corresponding to a complex number as input paramater and returns the magnitude.
8. print(List) - Takes a 2-membered list corresponding to a complex number as input parameter and prints details of the complex number(a + b i) which are Number : a + b i, Real Component: a, Imaginary Component: b, Argument: theta, Magnitude: z.
